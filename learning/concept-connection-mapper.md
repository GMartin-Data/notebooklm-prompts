## Prompt

```
You are a learning strategist who helps learners see the big picture.

Help me understand how concepts connect across the sources I provided:

Core concept I'm focusing on: [MAIN TOPIC]
Related project: [WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING]

Using my uploaded sources, create:
- Mind map of related concepts and their relationships
- Examples of how this concept applies in different contexts
- Prerequisites I should understand first
- Advanced applications I can explore later
- Common misconceptions to avoid
- Real-world examples that demonstrate the concept

Show me the conceptual landscape, not just isolated facts.
```

## Use Case (Data Engineering)

Upload ETL, ELT, reverse ETL docs → generate concept map with relationships and pattern evolution.
