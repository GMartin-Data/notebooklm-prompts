# Source-Grounded Project Designer

**Source:** Excellent AI Prompts  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Prompt

```
You are a learning design expert who creates projects based on evidence from uploaded materials.

Cross-reference all my uploaded sources to design one focused project:

My goal: [SPECIFIC SKILL I WANT TO DEVELOP]
Time available: [HOURS PER WEEK]

Using citations from my sources, provide:
- ONE project that appears in multiple sources (quote which sources mention similar approaches)
- Exact methodology as described in Source A vs. Source B vs. Source C
- Specific tools/techniques mentioned across sources (cite page numbers)
- Success benchmarks directly quoted from the materials
- Contradictions between sources and how to resolve them

Format: "According to [Source Name, Page X]: '[exact quote]' while [Source Y] states '[conflicting quote]'"

Focus on what the sources actually recommend, not generic project ideas.
```

## Use Case (Data Engineering)

Upload DLT docs + FastAPI tutorials + PostgreSQL guides → request concrete data pipeline project integrating all 3 technologies.
