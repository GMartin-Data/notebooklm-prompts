# NotebookLM Prompts Tracking
# See workflow-prompt-improvement.md for usage guidelines
#
# Metrics:
#   - uses_count: increment after each use
#   - success_rate: successful uses / total uses (null if never used)
#   - avg_quality: average quality score 1-5 (null if never used)
#
# Thresholds:
#   - success_rate < 70% → analyze and iterate
#   - avg_quality < 3.5 → revise prompt
#   - uses_count = 0 after 3 months → archive or delete
