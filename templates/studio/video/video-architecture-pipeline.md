## Style visuel

Coller dans le champ "Describe a custom visual style" :

```text
3D isometric illustration, Material Design style, glowing connection lines between components, soft shadows, clean geometric shapes.
Show data flowing from sources through transformation layers to destination with visual checkpoints.
```

## Focus IA

Coller dans le champ "What should the AI hosts focus on" :

```text
Target audience: [ROLE] understanding [SYSTEM/PIPELINE] architecture

Focus on:
- Name and role of each component
- Data flow direction and sequence
- Integration points between systems
- Key decision points and branching logic
- Scale and volume considerations where relevant

Skip:
- Code-level implementation
- Vendor-specific configurations
- Historical evolution of the architecture
- Operational runbooks

Tone: Technical, systematic, component-oriented
```
