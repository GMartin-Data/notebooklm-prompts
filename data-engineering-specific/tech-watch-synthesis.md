# Tech Watch Synthesis

**Source:** Custom  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Prompt

```
You are a technology analyst specializing in data engineering trends.

Analyze all uploaded tech watch sources and create:

**1. Emerging Technologies Report:**
- Tools/frameworks mentioned (frequency count)
- Adoption signals (quotes about usage)
- Maturity assessment (alpha/beta/production-ready)

**2. Comparative Analysis:**
[Create table comparing similar tools across sources]

**3. Recommendation:**
For my context [describe your needs], which technologies should I:
- Adopt now (cite readiness indicators)
- Watch closely (cite potential)
- Ignore (cite why not ready/relevant)

**4. Learning Resources:**
Extract best tutorials/docs mentioned in sources.

Cite every claim with [Source, Date, Quote].
```

## Use Case (Data Engineering)
